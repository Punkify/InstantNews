      <title>Three dead, eight wounded in US shooting</title>
      <description>A 15-year-old student opened fire at his Michigan high school on Tuesday, killing three teenagers and wounding eight other people before surrendering to police, authorities said, in what was the deadliest US school shooting so far this year. Eight others, including one teacher, were wounded in the attack, which took place shortly after noon while classes were in session at Oxford High School, the Oakland County Sheriff\'s Office said. The sheriff\'s office said the dead were a 16-year-old male, a 14-year-old female, and a 17-year-old female. Of the wounded, six were in stable condition and two were undergoing surgery. The suspect was taken into custody and a semi-automatic handgun was seized, but there was no immediate explanation for what might have prompted the attack in Oxford, a small town about 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of Detroit. "There was no resistance during the arrest and the suspect has asked for a lawyer and has not made any statements as to a motive," the sheriff\'s office said. "It\'s a very tragic situation," Undersheriff Michael McCabe told reporters. "We have three deceased victims right now, who are all believed to be students," he said. "We have lots of upset parents," he said. McCabe said police received more than 100 911 emergency calls shortly after noon, and that the shooter unleashed 15-20 shots over about five minutes. The suspect was taken into custody within five minutes of the first 911 call, he said.\'State of shock\'President Joe Biden was informed of the shooting during a visit to Minnesota. "My heart goes out to the families enduring the unimaginable grief of losing a loved one," he said. "That whole community has to be just in a state of shock right now." McCabe said police had been in contact with the suspect\'s parents and had searched their home. The suspect had been in class today and appeared to carry out the attack alone. It was unclear if victims had been specifically targeted or were randomly shot, McCabe said. "He\'s not talking to us at this time," he told reporters. McCabe said police were combing the scene at the school, which has about 1,800 students, and will want to interview anyone who might have information on the suspect. "I think this is every parent\'s worst nightmare," Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said at the same press briefing.\'Uniquely American problem\'It was the deadliest school shooting so far this year, according to Everytown For Gun Safety, a group which keeps statistics of mass shootings and lobbies for gun control. Before Tuesday\'s incident, there had been 138 shootings in schools across the United States in 2021, according to figures provided by Everytown.  In those incidents, 26 resulted in fatalities, though no more than two each time. Asked about the plague of mass shootings in the country, Whitmer replied: "This is a uniquely American problem that we need to address." The deadliest school shootings in US history were the April 2007 attack at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, which saw 33 killed, including the shooter, followed by the December 2012 attack on the Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, which left 28 dead, including 20 children and the shooter. In February 2018, a man with an AR-15 assault rifle opened fire in his former high school in Parkland, Florida, killing 17, in the deadliest-ever high school shooting. Shannon Watts, the founder of the group Moms Demand Action, called for more action to control firearms, saying there are 400 million guns owned by civilians across the country. "If more guns made us safer, we\'d be the safest nation in the world," Watts wrote on Twitter.</description>

      <title>Office realty leasing rises 30%, on track to beat last year high</title>
      <description>Mumbai: Robust demand for office spaces has pushed commercial property leasing in the first three quarters of 2019 by 30% from a year ago, taking it closer to entire 2018’s performance and making sure that this year surpasses the peak touched last year.Driven by tech corporates — accounting for about a third of the leasing activity — office space take-up touched 47 million sq ft in the first nine months against entire 2018’s performance of 48.9 million sq ft, showed data from CBRE South Asia. With this, office leasing activity is now expected to touch its highest level ever, estimated to be over 60 million sq ft in 2019.Leasing activity stood at about 15.4 million sq ft during the quarter ended September, rising by nearly 23% on an annual basis. This was dominated by small- to medium-sized transactions. Small-sized transactions of less than 10,000 sq ft accounted for over 40% of the transaction activity in the quarter.\n  \n  \n  \n  71641558\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“With office leasing scaling a historic high in 2019, we expect further strengthening of occupier sentiment in the medium to long term, backed by corporates looking to expand or consolidate their operations. Favourable government initiatives, transparency in the real estate sector and the right reforms will improve investor sentiment greatly in the coming quarters,” said Anshuman Magazine, CEO, India, South-east Asia, Middle East and Africa, CBRE.Like last year, he expects occupiers would put in greater efforts to incorporate flexibility in their portfolios due to changes in the business environment. Occupiers continued to futureproof their portfolios and hedge against future rental escalations by pre-leasing space across various cities.Bengaluru, followed by Hyderabad, dominated large-sized deal closures, while a few large deals were also reported in the NCR and Pune as well. Large-scale deal closures were mostly dominated by tech firms and flexible space operators. Firms belonging to sectors such as research, consulting &amp; analytics, banking, financial services &amp; insurance (BFSI), and engineering &amp; manufacturing also closed large-sized deals.Tech corporates led the office space take-up, followed by research, consulting &amp; analytics companies (19%) and flexible space operators (15%). The rise in the share of flexible space operators (10% in the second quarter of 2019) was primarily a result of their continued expansion across almost all cities.“The share of the tech sector rose from 31% to 40% annually during 2019 year-to-date, which implies that a rise in technology alternatives, insourcing / job preservation in the US and a global slowdown have not had any specific impact on India’s position as a preferred outsourcing destination for both high-skilled and low-skilled tech services, research and development,” said Ram Chandnani, managing director, advisory &amp; transaction services, India, CBRE South Asia.Supply addition rose by more than 80% in 2019 YTD on an annual basis, with about 43.5 million sq. ft. of development completions reported.Four cities — Hyderabad, Bengaluru, NCR and Mumbai — accounted for almost 80% of this supply addition.Compared to the first three quarters in 2018, the share of SEZs in supply dipped from 40% to 27% during 2019 YTD. Supply addition in the quarter also rose by about 6% on a quarterly basis, touching about 15 million sq. ft. More than 70% of this supply was driven by Hyderabad and NCR, followed by Bengaluru.</description>

      <title>Developers may face liquidity crisis on NBFC woes: Fitch</title>
      <description>MUMBAI: Liquidity risk is increasing for Indian-based real-estate developers, as non-bank financial institutions (NBFI; including housing finance companies) are shying away from lending to the sector, said Fitch Ratings.Developers that rely on refinancing from NBFIs, particularly those with weak financial profiles, will be affected the most should conditions persist. The availability of unencumbered assets among large developers may be of limited use, as NBFIs are looking to shed their already-high exposure to the sector, especially to large borrowers.NBFIs have disproportionately increased their share of real-estate sector credit in the previous few years, owing to heightened risk aversion by banks; banks have been cutting exposure due to their own funding challenges that began in late 2018, which have become more acute in the previous few months; domestic bank exposures fell to 2.3% of loans in the financial year ending March 2019 from 2.8% in 2015-16.NBFIs are now also shying away from refinancing maturing debt of even large, proven developers to limit concentration risk to the sector. This is pushing developers towards alternative funding channels, such as private equity. The availability of such funding could be more limited than the value of maturing debt and may only be available to established developers with sufficient unpledged assets. It would also come at a higher cost. We believe banks may still consider exposure to quality real estate, but overall exposure continues to decline.Developers that are focused on high-end projects may face higher risk, as sales of such projects have slowed in the last two years. We believe these developers would be wary of taking sharp price corrections on unsold inventory to boost sales, except in extreme circumstances, as this could diminish the value of unsold inventory and weaken collateral cover for existing lenders.In addition, any boost in sales would be temporary. Meanwhile, developers with substantial exposure to affordable housing may still benefit from marginal access to lenders in light of healthy pre-sales growth, supported by India\'s substantial housing deficit and government incentives for buyers via the credit-linked subsidy scheme as well as for developers, including tax deductions and grant of infrastructure status, which entitles companies to some benefits and concessions.The government has announced measures to improve NBFI-sector liquidity, but their efficacy remains to be seen. For example, we believe the government\'s July 2019 announcement to provide a first-loss guarantee of 10% on securitised assets issued by NBFIs to banks could ease funding pressure for NBFIs in the short term. However, the provision refers only to financially sound issuers and there is a lack of clarity about the duration of the guarantee and the definition of what comprises a \'financially sound\' entity. In addition, most of the actions by the authorities to alleviate the liquidity squeeze will benefit the largest and least risky NBFIs and is unlikely to address the pressure on the more property focused players.Defaults by two NBFIs - Infrastructure Leasing &amp; Financial Services Ltd (IL&amp;FS) in September 2018 and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) in June 2019 - have contributed to the sector-wide liquidity squeeze, as investors have become more risk averse. Banks\' low appetite for lending to real-estate developers is evidenced by the usually high risk weights attached to such loans. These are due to developers\' typically low credit ratings amid high leverage, making exposure to the sector an inefficient use of banks\' already-limited capital.Substantial bank recapitalisation to increase lending capacity could benefit NBFIs as well as real-estate developers, subject to the banks\' risk appetite. Although a structural improvement in NBFI asset books would take time. Nonetheless, even under better conditions we expect NBFI\'s to tighten credit standards, with developers facing funding pressure until there is a broader improvement in their operations, with better end-user demand and pricing support. </description>

      <title>For top FMCG companies, rural is the best bet</title>
      <description>Top consumer goods companies said demand in villages is still resilient and continues to drive their revenue, though the pace of growth has slowed due to the high base last year.Companies, during their September-quarter earnings, had highlighted that data, especially from market research agency Nielsen, which indicated that overall market growth had slowed down, especially in rural areas. However, the rural market has already surpassed pre-Covid levels, they said. According to Nielsen, the rural markets declined 2.9% in sales volume during the September quarter, though it grew 9.4% in value terms."There are a lot of optics in data, both externally and internally, because of Covid. During the first lockdown, urban cities were closed but business in rural areas continued. So, you have different comparators and so on. When I look at this data, shown of these quarterly and annual movements, I don\'t see a specific rural slow down, even though optically the rural numbers are lower," Godrej Consumer Products managing director Sudhir Sitapati told investors.88019764In fact, Dabur said the urban market has not reached the pre-Covid level expansion rate yet, despite higher growth from a year earlier during the September quarter on the back of modern trade recovery, ecommerce doing well, lockdown easing out and improved mobility."As per the syndicated data ... we find that urban areas are trending better compared to rural, which is very optically, the case being so. But if you look at CAGRs, pre-Covid, Covid and post-Covid, rural areas have been very, very resilient. As far as urban is concerned, urban growth is still not in line with what the pre-Covid growth was," Dabur chief executive Mohit Malhotra said.During its earnings conference, Hindustan Unilever, the country\'s biggest consumer goods firm, had first called out the slowdown in the rural market by citing Nielsen. However, Kantar, which tracks household consumption, said the market fell 2.6% in urban areas, but rural expanded 1.5% during the quarter."At present, rural slowdown is transitionary in nature. But inflation is the only joker in the pack and if it continues, then there could be a challenge in terms of rural demand," said Marico MD Saugata Gupta.</description>

      <title>United Breweries lays off over 150 mid, senior level employees</title>
      <description>United Breweries, the maker of the Kingfisher beer, has laid off more than 150 employees, mostly senior and mid-level executives, to reduce cost and create a leaner structure amid an uncertain demand outlook in the beer segment, people with knowledge of the matter said.The laid-off employees accounted for about 5% of the nearly 3,000 people employed by the country\'s largest brewer."United Breweries Ltd has reviewed its organisation structure to ensure it is lean, efficient and future-ready in light of the rapidly evolving market circumstances. It is a result of a comprehensive review of the organisation structure which is a part of a broader project that began last year. As an outcome of this review, some positions have been impacted," said a UB spokesperson, who did not specify how many people were laid off.In June, Dutch multinational Heineken had taken full control of UB, the erstwhile flagship brand of Vijay Mallya\'s UB Group. The Bengaluru-based company said the restructuring was not triggered by the Heineken acquisition.The retrenched employees have been extended support including severance benefits, access to outplacement services, health benefits and counselling services through the transition, the company said.</description>

      <title>ICICI Pru aims to raise Rs 2,000 crore via maiden alternative fund</title>
      <description>ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company is planning to raise up to Rs 2,000 crore through its maiden credit alternative investment fund (AIF) amid increasing demand for private credit.It will invest in the performing credit space with a credible promoter backing. It will aim to generate an 11-13%internal rate of return (IRR) with a four-year tenure.Companies are now seeking private credit to build capacity as banks are unwilling to give out long-term loans. The asset manager has decided to raise the fund privately rather than making it public as the appetite for such instruments from retail investors is low particularly after the blow-up of Franklin Templeton’s schemes.The minimum ticket size is Rs 1 crore. It is currently in talks with a host of family offices, financial institutions, and wealthy individuals to raise the money, market sources said.ICICI Prudential AMC declined to comment on the matter.The base size of the fund is pegged at Rs 1,000 crore with an option to retain subscriptions up to Rs 2,000 crore.The funds will be backed by tangible collaterals. The money could be deployed through multiple pockets including exercising warrants, payout on account of family settlements, new business ventures, purchase of shares from the secondary market and buying out of private equity stakes.The investee company can also use the proceeds to fund mergers and acquisitions and to infuse capital into subsidiaries.Assets under management for private credit has been steadily growing globally. It has expanded multiple times to $848 billion in 2020 from $315 billion in 2010, shows a report from EY. “Private credit’s appeal lies in the higher yields and diversification benefits the asset class offers,” the consultant firm said in the report.Back home, some top funds in this space including Edelweiss, Barings, Investec and Avendus are leading the trend.ICICI Prudential has even reached out to global investors with the new fund offer and could well garner a few international investors, sources said.High yield opportunities, according to EY are lucrative to investors, especially given the negative interest rate environment that persists in the global financial market.</description>

      <title>Apple faces Indian engineer’s bias lawsuit</title>
      <description>Apple Inc. lost an early round in a discrimination lawsuit brought in the U.S. by a female engineer from India who says her two managers -- one from her country, the other from Pakistan -- treated her as they would in their own countries: as a subservient.The woman’s case in California state court is the latest to allege workplace bias in Silicon Valley that focuses on cultural prejudices of some tech workers from South Asia. Cisco Systems Inc. is fighting a suit brought by California’s civil rights agency alleging bias against a member of India’s so-called lower castes, known as Dalits.Anita Nariani Schulze is part of the Sindhi minority -- she is Hindu, with ancestry in the Sindh region of what is now Pakistan. Her complaint alleges that her senior and direct managers, both male, consistently excluded her from meetings while inviting her male counterparts, criticized her, micromanaged her work, and deprived her of bonuses, despite positive performance evaluations and significant team contributions.Schulze claims the managers’ animus reflects sexism, racism, religious bias and discrimination on the basis of national origin. The Sindhi Hindu nationality is “known for its technical acumen” and its gender equality, she says, which “exacerbated the managers’ discriminatory treatment.”In a tentative ruling on Wednesday, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Sunil R. Kulkarni rejected Apple’s request to toss out the suit. While not ruling on the merits of the case, Kulkarni said Schulze had adequately supported her legal claims. Apple had argued her claims weren’t specific enough and were based on stereotypes.But the judge rejected Schulze’s request to represent a class of female Apple employees who suffered job discrimination over the last four years. He agreed with Apple that she didn’t show a pattern of discrimination that could be applied to a broader group.It wasn’t clear from the court’s docket whether the judge will hold a hearing Thursday before issuing a final ruling.Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.In the Cisco case, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing alleged that two Indian employees at the San Jose-based company discriminated against a Dalit co-worker on the basis of caste.Cisco has denied the claims, insisting it has “zero tolerance for discrimination.” It also said the lawsuit should be tossed out because caste isn’t a protected category under U.S. civil rights law.</description>

      <title>IITs witnessing an increasing number of trading firms</title>
      <description>Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are witnessing an increasing number of trading firms, led by high-frequency players that use complex computer programs to trade, visiting their campuses to hire top talent.Amsterdam-based Da Vinci Derivatives and Maverick Derivatives to Quantbox Research, Quadeye and Graviton Research are among the many making a beeline at these engineering colleges. Placement cells at the IIT of Kharagpur, Bombay, Madras and Kanpur are reporting a three- to five-fold increase in the number of such visiting firms this year, even as final placements begin Wednesday.With a surge in trading activity across the globe, especially over the last year, and high-frequency trading firms making big profits during markets volatility, these algorithmic trading platforms are chasing tech talent pools as they scale up.Some of these companies are expected to offer Rs 1 crore and beyond during final placements, say student representatives of placement cells.Last year was one for the record books when high-frequency trading firms made a lot of money through market-making, given how volatile the market was, said Prashant Singh, managing director, Quantbox Research.“Now that money is getting reinvested and put into building a talent pipeline for the future as we look at getting into more areas. A big opportunity also exists in the Indian market and there are only a few firms in the space,” he added.That is why competition is intense to get the top few students on campuses. Firms are frequently revising their packages to keep up with rivals because they don’t want to lose out on the best candidates.“We have revised our package and are now paying a base salary of Rs 40 lakh and sign-on bonus of Rs 10 lakh. The bonus range for the first year is Rs 20-40 lakh; for the second year Rs 30-60 lakh,” said Singh.“Da Vinci Derivatives is visiting some of the best IITs for roles like trader, quant analyst, software engineer,” said its head of legal, compliance and human affairs, Blerina Anastasi. As reported by ET on Tuesday, the package offered is euros 153,000 (Rs 1.3 crore) without stock options.“Da Vinci Derivatives is growing and we are looking at hiring top talent from the best Indian IITs,” said Anastasi. It is also visiting other leading universities in India to recruit freshers, she said.“High-frequency trading is mathematically and algorithmically driven, and our students are well-trained in these domains,” said IIT-Madras adviser (training &amp; placement) CS Shankar Ram. Last year four trading firms had visited the campus while about a dozen are expected this year.At IIT-Kharagpur, at least eight trading firms are likely to visit compared with two last year. IIT-Guwahati is expecting four-five such firms against one last year.IIT-Delhi has also seen an increasing number of trading firms visiting its campus. “These companies are now seriously hunting for key talent to build a strong back end," said Anishya Obhrai Madan, head of career services.</description>
